the trained models are saved under 
/mnt/DATA/model
Each directory is a DNN architecture 
    
    For example:
    modelCoapNet  is the COAPNet architecture model trained over the dataset
    the .out files are the reported logs along with the performance during the training
    
    find the file plankton-classifier.tfl.index under each directory. 
    This file has the weights and can be used as the trained model
